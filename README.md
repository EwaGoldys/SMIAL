Software for Multidimensional Data Analysis and Classification (SMIAL) is a user-friendly graphical user interface that enables end-to-end machine learning workflows for multidimensional imaging data without requiring programming skills.

SMIAL consists of six key panels for image and data analysis:
  1. Load Images  
  2. Segmentation and Masks  
  3. Preprocessing  
  4. Feature Generation  
  5. Data Cleaning and Statistics  
  6. Feature Analysis

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the SMIAL folder from the github repository: https://github.com/EwaGoldys/SMIAL.git
2. Install SMIAL
   - Run the MyAppInstaller_web file and follow the on-screen prompts.  
   - Select a destination folder for installation. 
   - Note if Windows displays a warning about an unknown publisher, click "More info" and then "Run anyway". This warning will not appear in future launches.
   - If Matlab Runtime is not installed on the computer, the user will also be prompted to download Matlab Runtime. 
3. Open SMIAL
   - Once installed, SMIAL software is available in the selection application folder.
   - Double-click the SMIAL icon to activate the software.

## Additional Notes

- **SMIAL was developed using MATLAB R2024a**, but it is distributed as a **stand-alone application** and does not require a local MATLAB installation to run.

- For installation instructions, usage guidance, and system requirements, please refer to the user Manaul included in the repository.
